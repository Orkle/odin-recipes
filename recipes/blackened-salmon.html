    <h4>Blackening is a cooking technique used with any firm-bodied fish, and it's popular
        with chicken as well. The fillets are brushed with butter, then coated liberally with
        a blend of herbs and spices. The salmon isn't burned, rather the color comes from the 
        milk solids in the butter deeply toasting and the spices charring when the fish hits 
        the hot pan.
