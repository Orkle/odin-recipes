    <h4>This recipe is fast and <em>delicious</em>! It can be done in 30 minutes, and feel free to use
    any fresh herb that you fancy. </h4>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul><li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 7 ounces each), cut into 1 - 1-1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons good olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 lemon, quartered (optional, serve on the side)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><em>For the Gravy:</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 heaping tablespoon of flour</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry the chicken cubes with paper towels and toss them
            with the flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Trust me, don't 
            be tempted to add more flour, the amount mentioned is perfect. 
            Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until very
            hot but not smoking, add the cubed chicken, and cook in one layer,
            for about 4-5 minutes. This will develop a lovely crust. Turn
            pieces of chicken and continue cooking for 3-5 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the garlic and parsley in a small 
            bowl. Add the butter and the parsley mixture to the skillet
            and saute for 1 minute longer, shaking the skillet ocasionally 
            to coat the chicken. Use a spoon to remove the chicken to a 
            plate, leaving brown bits, extra parsley and garlic in the pan.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><em>For the Gravy:</em></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If there's a lot of oil in the pan, remove all but about
            a tablespoon. Most likely you won't have to remove much. Add 
            the butter and cook over medium heat to melt. Add the flour and 
            mix together, cook for a minute or so, stirring continuously. 
            Slowly add the chicken broth, whisking to combine until all broth has 
            been added. Cook over medium high heat, stirring constantly until 
            gravy has cooked down a bit and thickened. Serve over chicken.
        </li>
    </ol>
